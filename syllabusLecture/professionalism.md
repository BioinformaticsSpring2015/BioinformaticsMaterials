###Professionalism

This course was designed to emulate a collaborative research environment you may encounter professionally after graduating. You are expected to attend and participate in class discussions as would suit a working environment.


Given the relevance of technology to the study of bioinformatics, you are encouraged to use laptops or tablets to take notes and share information during class. However, the use of technology should be a supplement to in-class learning and should never interfere with other students' ability to concentrate, so be judicious in your use of cell phones (i.e., texting during class is considered rude). 


I encourage you to work in groups to study and discuss class materials. You assume full responsibility for all submitted assignments, however, which means that you are expected to fully and accurately document your sources for relevant code and concepts. Please see the supplemental document on Blackboard for more information about plagiarism and appropriate citations.


The University of Texas at Tyler's honor code compels us to embrace: "Honor and integrity that will not allow me to lie, cheat, or steal, nor to accept the actions of those who do." I will not tolerate violations of academic integrity; possibly penalties may include failure of this course and University disciplinary action as described by the Manual of Policies and Procedures for Student Affairs, Chapter 8: Student Conduct and Discipline (http://www.uttyler.edu/mopp/).
