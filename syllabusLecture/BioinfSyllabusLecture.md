**Office:** BEP 103; **Phone:** 903.565.5882; **Email:** khertweck@uttyler.edu

The best way to contact me is by email. I try to respond to student emails within 12 hours during the week and 48 hours over the weekend.

**Office hours:** Tuesday 11 am to 12 pm, Wednesday 9 am to 11 am. If you are unable to meet during these times, please email me with alternative suggestions for times on Monday through Friday, 8 am to 6 pm.

###Course description

Covers principles and methods of analyzing large biological datasets with emphasis on genomes and transcriptomes. This is a practical course in Bioinformatics which will emphasize how to use the computer as a tool for genomic data analysis.

This course is offered as a part of an undergraduate minor in Bioinformatics and Genomics, although students who have not declared the minor are welcome to take it as well.

###Course pre-requisites

**Pre-requisites:** BIOL 1307/1106 (General Biology 1 with lab) and BIOL 1307/1107 (General Biology 2 with lab).

**Co-requisite:** BIOL 4106 (Bioinformatics lab). The material covered in these two classes are complementary and will be integrated throughout the semester. However, the focus for lecture vs. lab  is slightly different, so your performance for each class will be assessed independently.

###Course objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

* Describe the scope of bioinformatics research and applications
* Design and implement bioinformatics pipelines to answer pre-defined questions from a variety of biological disciplines
* Validate results from bioinformatics algorithms using hypothesis testing, correcting for multiple comparisons, etc.
* Characterize the limitations of data to answer questions of interests
* Obtain resources to learn new languages and algorithms

###Class materials

**Textbooks**

* **OpenIntro Statistics**, available to download for free online at http://www.openintro.org/stat/ or purchase hard copy through Amazon (see link).
* **Practical Computing for Biologists**, Haddock and Dunn, ISBN 978-0-87893-391-4


**Web resources**

* **Blackboard:** I will use the site for this course provided by the University (https://blackboard.uttyler.edu/) to share lecture slides, PDFs of additional readings, lists of resources, etc. Your grades will also be posted here, and a number of assessments throughout the semester will utilize the tools available in the site. 
* **Google:** All of the material we will cover this semester has been discussed at length on the internet. A quick search will probably yield an answer to most technical questions (from sites like StackOverflow and SeqAnswers), and searching for more information about conceptual topics will help you develop a deeper understanding of the nuances of the problems we are trying to solve. We'll talk in class about how to make your searches more efficient, as well as ways to discern between "good" and "bad" answers.

###Grading

Your performance in this class will be based on rubric-based scoring of assignments submitted throughout the semester. Rubric scores on all assignments will be averaged and converted to a percentage with final grades assigned using the following scale: 100-90%: A; 89-80%: B; 79-70%: C; 69-60%: D; <59: F

**Weekly assignments** may occur both inside and outside of class, including but not limited to the following formats: informal reflective writing, short answer questions, small group discussion/synopsis and peer review. Please see Blackboard for an updated schedule of assignment due dates (generally one per week). **For assignments turned in late, two rubric points per day will be deducted.**


**A class project** will be selected by you based on your personal interests in bioinformatics research and applications. You will have the opportunity to submit a topic proposal and draft of your presentation prior to sharing your findings with the class at the end of the semester. Each submission for the class project will be assessed the same as a regular assignment.

###Professionalism

This course was designed to emulate a collaborative research environment you may encounter professionally after graduating. You are expected to attend and participate in class discussions as would suit a working environment.


Given the relevance of technology to the study of bioinformatics, you are encouraged to use laptops or tablets to take notes and share information during class. However, the use of technology should be a supplement to in-class learning and should never interfere with other students' ability to concentrate, so be judicious in your use of cell phones (i.e., texting during class is considered rude). 


I encourage you to work in groups to study and discuss class materials. You assume full responsibility for all submitted assignments, however, which means that you are expected to fully and accurately document your sources for relevant code and concepts. Please see the supplemental document on Blackboard for more information about plagiarism and appropriate citations.


The University of Texas at Tyler's honor code compels us to embrace: "Honor and integrity that will not allow me to lie, cheat, or steal, nor to accept the actions of those who do." I will not tolerate violations of academic integrity; possibly penalties may include failure of this course and University disciplinary action as described by the Manual of Policies and Procedures for Student Affairs, Chapter 8: Student Conduct and Discipline (http://www.uttyler.edu/mopp/).
