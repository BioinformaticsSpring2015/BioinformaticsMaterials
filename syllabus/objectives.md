##Course objectives

Students should be able to:
* Describe the scope of bioinformatics research and applications
* Design and implement bioinformatics pipelines to answer pre-defined questions from a variety of biological disciplines
* Validate results from bioinformatics algorithms using hypothesis testing, correcting for multiple comparisons, etc.
* Characterize the limitations of data to answer questions of interests
* Obtain resources to learn new languages and algorithms
Bioinformatics is the science of analyzing the structure and function of genes and proteins with the aid of computers, statistics, and pattern recognition. Bioinformatics is a rapidly evolving and developing field both in terms of breadth of scope of useful applications and in terms of depth of what can be accomplished. This course is designed to introduce bioinformatics at a level appropriate for biology majors having completed the lower-division core, and for chemistry, computer science, and math majors with an interest in biology. Students will learn to use conventional software, web-based applications, and software. There will be an integration of the basics of computation and analysis along with chemistry and biology throughout the course. At the end of this course, there should be a solid understanding of the scope of bioinformatics. It is expected that the basic knowledge can be applied in many different fields of interest. Students should gain substantial competency in content, skills, and awareness within the field of bioinformatics.
