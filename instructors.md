###Information for instructors

If you're interested in using GitHub for a class, first check out the [Classroom Guide](https://education.github.com/guide) and think about how you would incorporate repositories into your materials and assessments.

The materials in this repository are designed for a college-level bioinformatics laboratory. The class meets for three hours each week in a single session, and compliments a separate three hour lecture. I've designed the lecture to provide more conceptual information about bioinformatics, while the lab focuses on technical details. Each lab session includes a short dicussion at the beginning to talk about the themes and goals for that day. While learning objectives are included at the top of each week's lab, the specific slides are not yet posted here.
