#Bioinformatics Week 7 Lab
##Sequence searching

Slides for the introduction to today's lab, as well as a PDF of this document, can be found on [Blackboard](http://blackboard.uttyler.edu).

###Learning Objectives
You should be able to:

1. perform sequence searches (BLAST) using NCBI's online interface
2.

* 

Additional materials for reference:
* [BLAST on NCBI](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)

###Activities

**Web-based BLAST**
