###Activities

**Register for an account with TACC**

After spring break, we're going to be using some programs located on remote clusters owned by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in Austin, Texas. You'll need to sign up for an account with TACC for me to grant you access to our class account. 

Go to the [TACC user portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/) and click "Create a TACC account." Read through the new user information and accept the terms and conditions (I assure you that all activities I will ask you to perform on these resources abide by these policies). Enter only the required fields (marked with a red asterisk), and use your UT Tyler email address. Your PI Eligibility is "Ineligible." 

Once you have signed up for an account, your instructor will be able to grant you access to Lonestar, the cluster we'll be using for class.
