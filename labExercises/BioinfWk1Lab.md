#Bioinformatics Week 1 Lab

Slides for the introduction to this course, as well as a PDF of this document, can be found on [Blackboard](http://blackboard.uttyler.edu).

###Learning Objectives
1. Conceptualize version control and collaborative research using the GitHub web interface
2. Submit your homework electronically through a GitHub repository
3. Format text using a simple computer language (markdown)
4. Apply information from basic software documentation to perform bioinformatics tasks

###Activities
* Create a GitHub account 
	* Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com) in a web browser (Firefox preferred) 
	* Enter university email, select username/password, submit
	* Apply for a GitHub Student Developer Pack. This collection of developer tools is available to students for free, and includes an upgraded GitHub account that allows private repositories. Later in today's lab, you will make a private repo for yourself and share it with your instructor so you can submit homework confidentially.
		* Go to [the application page](https://education.github.com/pack/join) and confirm you are a student. 
		* You will be prompted to enter an image of your student ID. We can scan an image in class if you did not bring one.
		* For how you plan to use GitHub, please write a few sentences to indicate you are a student in bioinformatics and will be using GitHub to develop a collection of example code and submit homework.
		* It may take a day or so for the request for student developer tools to be approved, so watch your email for the confirmation notice.

* Go through GitHub's introductory material
	* Navigate in a web browser to [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com)
	* Work through the instructions on the following guides, and keep in mind that links are highlighted in blue and may contain additional information if you have questions:
		* Hello World
		* Forking Projects
		* Be Social (you may want to "Watch" or "Star" the repo for this class)		
		* Mastering Markdown

* Set up your personal homework repo
	* Fork the [ForkMe repo](https://github.com/k8hertweck/ForkMe)
	* Change the settings of this repo to private, and add your instructor (k8hertweck) as a collaborator.
	* Rename your newly forked repository
		* Go to the [GitHub help page](https://help.github.com) and find the article that describes how to rename a repository.
		* Rename your new branch of ForkMe in the format LastnameBioinf (e.g., HertweckBioinf).
		* Modify the README.md file to describe this repo
		* Create new file in this repo and answer questions
		* make repo private

###Assessment
1. Complete the "GitHub survey" in [Blackboard](http://blackboard.uttyler.edu)
