###Grading

Your performance in this class will be based on rubric-based scoring of assignments submitted throughout the semester. Rubric scores on all assignments will be averaged and converted to a percentage with final grades assigned using the following scale: 100-90%: A; 89-80%: B; 79-70%: C; 69-60%: D; <59: F

**Weekly assignments** may include b. Please see Blackboard for an updated schedule of assignment due dates (generally one per week). **For assignments turned in late, two rubric points per day will be deducted.**


**A class project** will be conducted in the second part of the semester. You will be assigned a unique dataset to analyze using the tools learned each week. You will submit preliminary results for grading prior to a short presentation at the end of the semester. Each submission for the class project will be assessed the same as a regular assignment.
