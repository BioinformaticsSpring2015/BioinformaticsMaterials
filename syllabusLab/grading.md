##Grading

Student assessment will be based on two types of tasks: 1) weekly assignments, and 2) a class project.

Weekly assignments may occur both inside and outside of class, including but not limited to the following formats: informal reflective writing, short answer questions, small group discussion/synopsis and peer review.

The two exams will assess your understanding of each of the two parts of the course: 1) Bioinformatics Framework, and 2) Applied Bioinformatics. 

You will select a topic for your class project based on your personal interests in bioinformatics research and applications. You will have the opportunity to submit a topic proposal and draft of your presentation prior to sharing your findings with the class at the end of the semester. 

Your performance will be based on rubrics that outline your mastery the course material and allow you to target areas for improvement. 

Final grades will be assessed using the following weighting:  60% weekly assignments, 40% research project. 

100-90%: A; 89-80%: B; 79-70%: C; 69-60%: D; <59: F
