###Course pre-requisites

Pre-requisites: BIOL 1307/1106 (General Biology 1 with lab) and BIOL 1307/1107 (General Biology 2 with lab).

Co-requisite: BIOL 4306 (Bioinformatics lecture). The material covered in these two classes are complementary and will be integrated throughout the semester. However, the focus for lecture vs. lab  is slightly different, so your performance for each class will be assessed independently.
