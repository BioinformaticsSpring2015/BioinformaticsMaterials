###Textbooks, materials, and websites

**Textbooks** (same as lecture)
 
* **OpenIntro Statistics**, available to download for free online at http://www.openintro.org/stat/ or purchase hard copy through Amazon (see link).
* **Practical Computing for Biologists**, Haddock and Dunn, ISBN 978-0-87893-391-4


**Other materials**

* **Flashdrive**, at least 1 GB


**Web resources**

* **Blackboard:** I will use the site for this course provided by the University (https://blackboard.uttyler.edu/) to share lecture slides, PDFs of additional readings, lists of resources, etc. Your grades will also be posted here, and a number of assessments throughout the semester will utilize the tools available in the site. 
* **Google:** All of the material we will cover this semester has been discussed at length on the internet. A quick search will probably yield an answer to most technical questions (from sites like StackOverflow and SeqAnswers), and searching for more information about conceptual topics will help you develop a deeper understanding of the nuances of the problems we are trying to solve. We'll talk in class about how to make your searches more efficient, as well as ways to discern between "good" and "bad" answers.
* **GibHub Student Developer Pack:** available for free with your UT Tyler student email and ID card (https://education.github.com/pack). We will set this up together in your first lab meeting.
