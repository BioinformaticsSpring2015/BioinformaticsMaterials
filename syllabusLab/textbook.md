###Textbooks, materials, and websites

**Textbooks** (same as lecture)
 
* **OpenIntro Statistics**, available to download for free online at http://www.openintro.org/stat/ or purchase hard copy through Amazon (see link).
* **Practical Computing for Biologists**, Haddock and Dunn, ISBN 978-0-87893-391-4


**Web resources**

* **Blackboard:** I will use the site for this course provided by the University (https://blackboard.uttyler.edu/) to share lecture slides, PDFs of additional readings, lists of resources, etc. Your grades will also be posted here, and a number of assessments throughout the semester will utilize the tools available in the site.
* **Google:** All of the material we will cover this semester has been discussed at length on the internet. A quick search will probably yield an answer to most technical questions (from sites like StackOverflow and SeqAnswers), and searching for more information about conceptual topics will help you develop a deeper understanding of the nuances of the problems we are trying to solve. We'll talk in class about how to make your searches more efficient, as well as ways to discern between "good" and "bad" answers.
* **GitHub class repository:** We will be referencing documents, data, and code included in a repository for this class, found at https://github.com/k8hertweck/Bioinformatics.
* **GibHub Student Developer Pack:** available for free with your UT Tyler student email and ID card (https://education.github.com/pack). We will set this up together in your first lab meeting.


**Other materials**

* **Flashdrive**, at least 1 GB
* **Desktop computers in BEP 139:** The computers in our lab have been pre-installed with the software necessary to perform all lab assignments. You should be able to complete homework requiring this software during class. If you require additional time, please contact me to schedule access to the lab.
* **Using your personal computer (laptop):** Please see the documentation in the GitHub class repository for more information about installing the software used in class on your personal computer.
