###Installing Bioinformatics Software

**For both Windows and Mac**

* [**Git**](https://help.github.com): While you can accomplish many things using the web interface, I recommend installing the command line tools (and perhaps also the desktop client).
* [**R statistics software**](http://cran.revolutionanalytics.com) with [**Rstudio**](http://www.rstudio.com) for a great working environment for the language


**Windows**

* **Text editor:** [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) or [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org)
* **Unix shell:** [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com), which has the option to install perl, python and other languages as well.


**Mac**

* **Text editor:** [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)
* **Unix shell:** Terminal, which is pre-installed on MacOSX. You can find it through the Finder by going to Go->Utilities->Terminal.
