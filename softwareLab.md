###Installing Bioinformatics Software

**For both Windows and Mac**

* [**Git**](https://help.github.com): While you can accomplish many things using the web interface, I recommend installing the command line tools and desktop client.
* [**R statistics software**](http://cran.revolutionanalytics.com) with [**Rstudio**](http://www.rstudio.com) for a great working environment for the language
* Consider applying for the [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com). You'll get lots of free tools, including an upgraded GitHub account that allows private repos.


**Windows**

* **Text editor:** [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) or [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org)
* **Unix shell emulator:** [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com), which has the option to install many other tools as well. 
  * tools required for this class: nano, wget, zip, unzip, make
  * other tools that might be useful: perl, python
  * The installation instructions on Cygwin are fairly straightforward. Go to the [Cygwin website](https://www.cygwin.com) and select the page on the left to "Download Cygwin." Click on `setup-x86_64.exe` to download the file. When the download is complete, click on it to open the installer. On most machines, you should be able to click through the default settings (it also probably doesn't matter which mirror you select for downloading). While lots of great tools are added by default, you will need to add some additional packages (listed above). Search for the package name; it may appear in a few categories. Expand each category (click `+`) until you find the exact name for the package and click on Skip; it will change to Install. Do the same for each additional package. Then click next, then Finish. 
  * If you have already installed Cygwin and need to add more tools, you can follow the same general procedure listed above.


**Mac**

* **Text editor:** [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/), or [Atom](https://atom.io) as mentioned in the GitHub student developer pack.
* **Unix shell:** Terminal, which is pre-installed on MacOSX. You can find it through the Finder by going to Go->Utilities->Terminal.
